                <h2>what is Programming!?</h2>
                <P> Programming is everything you see work without breathing<br></P>
                <p>
                    the fan is programmed, the T.V is programmed, the airconditaion is programmed, and for                       sure computers and smart phones are programmed<br>
                    you can't spend a whole day without dealing with something has been programmed <br>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    so you can think about programming as a way to speak with almost any machine and tell it                     exactly what you want it to do for you<br>
                <p>
                    imagine having an idea And after some years billions of people use                                           it! that's one of the power programming has!<br>
                    and think about the amount of money you will get of course <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    very well! I'm going to speak with the machine so cool but is't smart enough to                             understand me!?.. the answer is nope!<br>
                    computers are the most stupid things in this world which they will never do something                       unless you ask them to do, and to that you need languages to be able to communicate with                     them <br>
                    but first let me warn you as a programmer you will face horrible situations and this is                     one of them<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    SOooO what's Programming languages ? <br>
                    it's the same concept of any normal language you use to speak with people but now it's                       between you and the computer or whatever you're speaking to <br>
                    but why there are a lot of programming languages? <br>
                    because there are alot of different kinds of things you need to program and each one                         need to be spoken with its own language otherwise you may face some problem like trying                     to speak English with french people <br>
                    as you may know Computers just understand zeroes and ones, so you need understandable                       language to use, as it will be so horrible to write code just in zeroes and ones and                         here come the programming languages to solve this problem <br>
                </p>
                <p> this is a rank for most common used programming languages <br></p>
