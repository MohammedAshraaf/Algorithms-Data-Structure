                    <h2>Problem solving</h2>
                    <p>
                        Problem solving is concept we use everyday to overcome any issue faces us<br>
                        and in Programming it's the same as well as you're giving a problem from your life 
                        and try to solve it using programming<br>
                        there are a lot of benifits from solving such those problrms like training yourself 
                        on code, learn new algorithms and data structure, and train your brain as well to 
                        solve complex problem and become more creative <br>
                        there are lot of websites offering this environment where you can find more more 
                        problems to solve and test your code to see if you're right<br>
                        not just try your code but some websites allow you to see others code so you can 
                        learn from their experience, so you can apply for their contests on the website or 
                        the global contests<br>

                        <h2>Programming contests</h2>
                        <p>
                            Programming contests one of the most field which students seek<br>
                            there are brilliant companies such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft hosting 
                            every year contests in programming for students to encourage them learn this 
                            field and of course the winners are awarded amazing prizes<br>
                            Also one of the best programming contests for students is ACM which is usually 
                            having three levels, contest in Egypt, then the middle east, and the global 
                            one<br>
                            and most of students who are getting a good place in it have a job in the 
                            biggest companies as they would be smart and have amazing knowledge in 
                            Algorithms and data structure<br>
